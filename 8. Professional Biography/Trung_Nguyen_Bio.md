**Co-op Work Experience**

**Software Engineer Intern**  
_Viettel Cyber Security_ | Hanoi, Vietnam  
_August 2023 – December 2023_

- Led the implementation of a microservices architecture in Go to process over 10 TB of log entries daily from
network devices, enhancing security incident response times from 60 to 20 minutes
- Optimized Python legacy code for log parsing to handle concurrent log streams, increasing parsing throughput from
1 to 10 TB daily, and reducing CPU usage from 85% to 65% under high traffic
- Integrated a Kafka-based data integration layer with MongoDB databases, improving throughput from 500 MB to
4.5 GB of data per second, which reduced anomaly detection time from 30 to 6 minutes
- Collaborated with DevOps team to implement automated deployment pipelines across 50 Kubernetes clusters,
improving system uptime from 90% to 99% and reducing manual maintenance by 60 hours per month

**Software Engineer Intern**  
_Pythaverse_ | Hanoi, Vietnam  
_May 2023 – July 2023_

- Designed an API in Java Spring for an e-learning platform for middle school students, reducing average data
synchronization time from 3 seconds to 0.8 second for over 30,000 users
- Conducted automated tests for frontend and backend components, increasing test coverage from 200 to 1200 test
cases, which cut down manual testing time from 40 to 18 hours per week
- Proposed a state management with React Redux to ensure data consistency across 30 webpage components,
decreasing average page load time from 2 to 0.8 seconds
- Deployed components on AWS EC2 instances and leveraged AWS S3 for static assets storage, implementing
auto-scaling policies and optimizing instance types to reduce infrastructure costs by $1,000 per month

**Project Sought**

I am seeking a capstone project that challenges my expertise in backend engineering and system optimization. Ideally, the project would involve building scalable systems that can handle large volumes of data efficiently, or enhancing the performance of existing infrastructures. I am particularly interested in opportunities where I can further refine my skills in automation, caching strategies, and data processing, while also contributing to meaningful, real-world solutions.
