This project involves designing and deploying a distributed file system (DFS) that ensures efficient data storage and retrieval across multiple nodes. The primary objective is to create a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution capable of handling large volumes of data while maintaining high availability and reliability.

The DFS will support key functionalities such as data replication, fault tolerance, and seamless access across a distributed environment. To address economic constraints, the system will optimize resource allocation to minimize hardware and cloud infrastructure costs. Security is a top priority, with features like end-to-end encryption, role-based access controls, and real-time monitoring to safeguard data integrity and privacy.

Social considerations focus on ensuring user trust by implementing robust privacy protections and transparent data management practices. Additionally, the project will incorporate environmentally friendly strategies to reduce power consumption and optimize performance, aligning with sustainability goals. Overall, this DFS aims to deliver a high-performance, secure storage solution that meets the needs of modern, data-driven applications.
