Master Server:
- Purpose: The central authority that manages the file system's metadata. It stores information like file locations, permissions, and other attributes.
- Key Responsibilities:
    - Receives metadata requests from clients.
    - Provides metadata responses to clients.
    - Receives metadata and data location requests from the Storage Server.
    - Coordinates replication operations with the Replication Manager.

Client:
- Purpose: Any entity (user, application) that interacts with the file system.
- Key Responsibilities:
    - Sends metadata requests to the Master Server.
    - Receives metadata responses from the Master Server.
    - Sends file data requests to the Storage Server.
    - Receives file data from the Storage Server.

Storage Server:
- Purpose: Responsible for managing the physical storage of files and data.
- Key Responsibilities:
    - Receives metadata and data location requests from the Master Server.
    - Sends metadata and data location responses to the Master Server.
    - Receives file data from the Replication Manager.
    - Sends file data to the Chunk Manager.
    - Manages the distribution of file data across Storage Nodes.

Chunk Manager:
- Purpose: Manages the distribution of file data across Storage Nodes.
- Key Responsibilities:
    - Receives file data from the Storage Server.
    - Distributes file data to Storage Nodes.
    - Manages the replication of file data across Storage Nodes.

Replication Manager:
- Purpose: Responsible for managing the replication of file data across Storage Nodes.
- Key Responsibilities:
    - Receives replication operations from the Master Server.
    - Sends file data to the Storage Server.
    - Manages the replication status of file data.

Storage Nodes:
- Purpose: Store file data.
- Key Responsibilities:
    - Receive file data from the Chunk Manager.
    - Store file data.
    - Participate in the replication of file data.

Overall Function:
- This system, likely a distributed file system, provides a scalable and fault-tolerant way to store and manage file data. The Master Server coordinates the entire system, while the Storage Server and its components handle the actual storage and replication of data. Clients interact with the system to access and modify files.
