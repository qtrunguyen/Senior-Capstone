- As a software engineer, I want to read/write file from the storage system efficiently so that it can reduce latency and improve the performance of my application.
- As a data engineer, I want to store large datasets across multiple storage nodes so that I can ensure data reliability and high availability.
- As a security engineer, I want to maintain data integrity across distributed storage nodes so that I can ensure files are not corrupted or tampered with during storage or transfer
