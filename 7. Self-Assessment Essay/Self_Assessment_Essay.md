My senior design project involves developing a distributed file system that ensures reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant data storage across multiple nodes. From my academic perspective, this project embodies a culmination of my knowledge in distributed computing, cloud infrastructure, and software engineering. The system will enable efficient file storage and retrieval, replication for redundancy, and fault recovery to ensure data integrity. As the sole developer, I will be responsible for designing, coding, and testing each component, integrating various technologies and methodologies I have learned throughout my computer science education. This project challenges me to synthesize both theoretical concepts and practical skills to create a robust, real-world application.

My college curriculum has provided a strong foundation for tackling this project. In CS 5165: Introduction to Cloud Computing, I have equipped with essential knowledge about data distribution, fault tolerance, and consensus algorithms like Paxos and Raft. In CS 2028: Data Structures and Algorithms, I gained experience optimizing complex systems, which will be crucial when implementing efficient file indexing and retrieval processes. Additionally, CS 4029: Operating Systems taught me about process synchronization and inter-process communication, both critical aspects of distributed system design. These courses not only provided technical knowledge but also honed my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, which will guide me in designing and troubleshooting my project.

My co-op experiences at Viettel Cyber Security have further prepared me for this challenge. At Viettel, as a Software Engineer Intern, I developed a microservice architecture capable of processing over 10 TB of log data per day, which enhanced my understanding of handling large-scale data and building high-performance backends. Collaborating with the DevOps team on CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes deployments taught me about deployment automation and system reliability.

My motivation for this project stems from a genuine interest in distributed systems and a passion for solving complex infrastructure challenges. Building a distributed file system allows me to apply and expand my knowledge in a meaningful way, addressing real-world issues like data consistency and fault tolerance. My preliminary approach involves researching existing architectures, designing a modular system, and implementing components incrementally. I plan to use agile methodologies, setting small milestones to ensure steady progress and continuous validation.

To self-evaluate my contributions, I will establish clear success metrics, such as system performance benchmarks, fault tolerance tests, and user functionality validations. My goal is to ensure that the system can handle distributed storage, retrieval, and recovery seamlessly, with low latency and high availability. Regular code reviews and thorough testing will help maintain quality. I will consider the project successful if it meets the functional requirements, performs well under stress tests, and demonstrates robustness in fault scenarios. Ultimately, my aim is to build a system that reflects both my technical expertise and commitment to excellence.
