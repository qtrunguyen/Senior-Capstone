This project involves the design and implementation of a distributed file system, a system for managing and accessing large data files across multiple networked nodes. Our focus is on providing high scalability, fault tolerance, and seamless data access. Leveraging replication, load balancing, and data partitioning, the system aims to ensure efficient storage utilization and quick data retrieval, even under high traffic. Key components include metadata management, data consistency protocols, and secure access controls
